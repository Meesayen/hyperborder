## Installation
add it to plugins in your ~/.hyperterm.js configuration

````
module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: ['hyperborder']
  ...
}
````
then just restart your HyperTerm app or go to the menu 'Plugins / Update All Now'

## Configuration
I had to remove the configuration options. 
Maybe they will come back later.
